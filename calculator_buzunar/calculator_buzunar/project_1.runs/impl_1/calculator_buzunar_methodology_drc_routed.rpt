TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.689 ns between u_inmultitor/multiplier_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and u_inmultitor/product_reg[6]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
